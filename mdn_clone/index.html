              <p>
                Firefox 93 comes with lots of lovely updates including AVIF
                image format support, filling of XFA-based forms in its PDF
                viewer and protection against insecure downloads by blocking
                downloads relying on insecure connections.The post Lots to see

                Last year, during lockdown, many discovered the importance of
                PDF forms when having to deal remotely with administrations and
                large organizations like banks. Firefox supported displaying PDF
                forms, but it didnâ€™t support filling them: users had to print
                them, fill them by hand, and scan them back to digital form. We
                decided it was time to reinvest in the PDF viewer (PDF.js) and
                support filling PDF forms within Firefox to make our users'
                lives easier.The post Implementing form filling and

              <p>
                In a world where data and AI are reshaping society, people
                currently have no tangible way to put their data to work for the
                causes they believe in. To address this, we built the Rally
                platform, a first-of-its-kind tool that enables you to
                contribute your data to specific studies and exercise consent at
                a granular level. Mozilla Rally puts you in control of your data
                while building a better Internet and a better society. The post
